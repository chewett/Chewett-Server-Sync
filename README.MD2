=================

Given ftp and/or mysql details this will sync a site with a recent copy
and potentially in the future allow various daily/weekly/monthly backups
to be created

##Todo

* Database Sync
    * Syncing over SSH
    * Database dump flags
    * Pattern matching of tables to download
* Only keep X number of daily backups
* Specify number of daily backups to keep
* FTP syncing
    * SFTP support
    * Syncing entire directories
    * Possibly rsync style copy via local cache?
